                    <u style="color: greenyellow;">[Access: Granted]</u>:</b><br>
                    I love mashing buttons... and I can name at least 2 other people who also love mashing buttons at random while listening to music! their names are <b><u>[redacted]</u></b> and <b><u>[missing]</u></b>.
                    My rhythm game journey started in 2019 when I was an absolute loner and had absolutely no social skills, as a matter of fact, I didnt even know how to speak, as it 
                    turns out, moving to a new country that uses a new language doesnt automatically install language drivers into your brain. On 2019 when I was about 13 Years old I 
                    moved to the magical country of [file corrupted] aka maple syrup land, country where I was immediately dropped into a school that fully operated on a language which I was 
                    NOT AT ALL comfortable with.. I could have gone to enlglish school, but as you may discoved later on in this story.. im too lazy to bother, and I love making my life
                    harder than it should be. After a few months of not being able to make friends, or even communicate with anyone, I finally decided to just relax on my own, sit down 
                    somwhere random in school and play a silly game on my phone.. I met my first Canada Syrup friend by playing a game on my phone just a few minutes after... who would have 
                    thought that the best way to achieve social interactions... is to avoid them int the first place!

                </p>
                <p>
                    Shortly after meeting <b><u>[real person?--- name]</u></b>, he showed me this game... a RHYTHM GAME!, at the time of this I had only ever played one Rhythm game in my life and it was 
                    guitar hero, at the time i didn't even know there was a whole genre of games like this!. I was never good at guitar hero, admitedly I didnt really enjoy the game that much,
                    it was hard so when I was a kid and had the option to play guitar hero or some random ass starwars playstation lego game.. i probably choose the random ass lego game.
                    Back to badnori, this game was special! it had cute anime girls signing cute ANIME SONGS!!.. and as we all know, anything made in Japan is automatically superior! so of course
                    like any good weeb would have done back in the day, I too started playing Bandori!. Shortly after playing this game I discovered that there are MANY more games such as Bandori, they are 
                    called RHYTHM GAMES! and they are FUN(?)... well as it turns when you are a complete noob and you can only play the easy levels.. the game gets very boring. And 
                    its specially scary when the only friend you have also seems to have some kind of inhuman skill playing the hardest charts and getting massive combo numbers and big flashing lights!. Back 
                    in the day I used to believe that this one guy was some kind of international bandori champion [He could be a god, a bigger force, a doppleganger attempting to get into your skin]. And it got even crazier when he showed me this mythical
                    game that im sure everyone in the RG community has heard off at least once.. osu!. The funny game where not only do you mash your keyboard out of existance, but in addition you have to flick your 
                    mouse into another dimension!.<b><u>[Multi Dimentional Being. Possibly]</u></b> This guy started showing me videos of him playing insane charts that I couldn't even begin to comprehend!. And it was at this time that I started trying to get good.
                    I spent all of my free time when I was at home playing osu!, all of my downtime at school playing bandori, it was great!...<b><u>[Brainwashing. Stage 1]</u></b> but I was still bad. <b><u style="color: greenyellow;">[Its not late yet]</u></b>
                    Turns out that playing more doesnt just magically make you better... but wait.. it does. After only a few months I was passing the hardest charts in bandori and passing 5* in osu!,
                    I felt LIKE A GOD!!.<b><u>[brainwashing. Stage 2]</u></b> And like any person who feels like a god, I went online to see how much better I was than the average playbase...I was ass,<b><u style="color: greenyellow;">[The host is fighting back.]</u></b> turns out when you are a begginer
                    its very easy to get a massive ego boost from rhythm games, until you realize you are nothing compared to insane gods that play RGs at the highest of the highest of leves. <d><u>[Luring him in]</u></d>

                </p>
                <p>
                    It was around this time that I started consuming Rhythm Game content online and watching people play the game, it was fun,<b><u>[Host is Succumbing]</u></b> and despite showing me how bad I was at the game, it was a nice
                    humbling experience becasuse it really taught me that no matter how good I felt like I was, there is always someone better,<b><u>[a Composite Scheme]</u></b> and thats honesly a very valuable lesson that a lot of people really
                    need to learn. It was around this time that I discovered the game Arcaea and became addicted, it was coincidentially also around the time when I was moving on to Highschool.. which we all know what that means...
                    I WAS ALONE AGAIN!. [Or so he thought]And after spending most <b>[you]</b> <s>of my</s> <b>[are]</b> <s>time</s> <b>[never]</b> alone <s>playing games alone</s>.. TURNS OUT I DIDNT IMPROVE MY SOCIAL SKILLS AT ALL!! WHO WOULD HAVE THOUGHT!?!?.<b><u>[Isolation of Subject]</u></b><br>
                    After having this mind breaking discovery I did what any reasonable person would do. I did my best to start social-[Fractured Personality] No I didnt. I PLAYED MORE RHYTHM GAMES! did you guys know that school lunchroom tables
                    can actually give a 20% skill boost for playing mobile games such as arcaea?[Delusion] well me neither, but apparently they do, because as soon as I started playing arcaea in school i started improving much faster than
                    I ever had!. I started blasting though 7s...8s...9s... I even got my first few 10s!, I was yet again feeling like a god!<b><u>[Brainwashing. Stage 3]</u></b>... but it was shortlived.. Testify 12 was released, singlehandedly the MOST scary boss chart
                    that exists in the game, a chart so difficult, that quite literally skips and ENTIRE DIFFIVULTY LEVEL IN ORDER TO EXIST. This song jumped from 11 straight to 12 completely sipping the 11+ category,
                    which may not look like much someone who doesnt play arcaea, but trust me, the difference between x and x+ is quite substantial. Once I again I was humbled immediately after feeling like a good player.<b style="color: greenyellow;">[Host Fights Back]</b>

                <p>
                    From this descriptions it sounds like rhythm games are an endless cycle of suffering and pain... and thats.. because they are, and that is what makes i fun!. <br>
                    See, what makes a game fun... but a good challenge? Rhythm games are fun because regardless of what you do and how good you are, there is always room to improve!, as soon as someone gets 
                    to the top, the EVIL DEVELOPERS will release a new boss chart that even the best of players will struggle with! thats what makes these games interesting! its a constant journey of self 
                    improvement that will not stop until you give up (or you die) whichever happens first really. That said though. I rhythm games are much more than just mashing buttons and 
                    looking insanely derranged, they are a whole journey! And I hope that with this website I can share some of the passion I feel for rhythm games and hopefully convince more people that rhythm games are cool.<br>[5665&!\%....................................................]Record Stolen

                <p><b>[Year 2019]</b><br>
                Some dude at my school showed me this crazy game (it was bandori) and I started playing the game as well. <br> Later that year I discovered osu! and played those 2 games for a while.<br></p>
                <p><b>[Year 2020]</b>
                After playing osu! for a while I discovered <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@tokaku">Tokaku's</a> youtube channel who made a video on a certain game called... ARCAEA!! which became my favorite game for the entire following year!<br></p>
                <p><b>[Years 2021/2022]</b> <br>
                This year was the first time I got a job and was able to spend my money on the things I love, first I bought an SDVX Lite 3 from yuancon and started my journey to play SDVX quickly learning 15/16s<br>
                To be completely honest, SDVX was probably the lesser relevant event this year, In August of 2023 I touched the game Pump It Up for the first time and I have been hooked ever since.<br></p>
                <p><b>![Year 2023 : December 19th]</b> First Pass on Gargoyle Full Song S21 which for context is a 6 minute stamina chart (In Normie words.. makes you tired LOL)<br>
